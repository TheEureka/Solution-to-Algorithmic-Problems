Firstly, notice that the condition $1 <= a_i <= k " for each " 1 <= i <= |a|$ can simply be ignored, as this is always true when $1 <= x <= k.$

Suppose that we have a two dimension array $f$, where $f[x]["len"]$ denotes the number of ways to expresss $x$ as the product of "len" prime numbers, where the order of primes in the presentation matters. That is, $6 = 2 times 3$ and $6 = 3 times 2$ are regarded as different representations. 

Finding the value of $f[x]["len"]$ for all useful values of $x$ and "len" is not a difficult task.

To find these values, consider what happens after we have fixed the value of $x$ to an integer between $1$ and $k$ inclusive. We can now iterate over the value of "len" less than or equal to $n$. For each pair of $x$ and "len", we know that there are $f[x]["len"]$ integer arrays $a$ if $|a| = "len"$ and each value in $a$ is greater than $1$. To take into account the extra ones, note that in reality, $|a|$ can now take any value from $"len"$ to $n$. When $|a|$ is fixed, the number of arrays $a$ is simply given by the expression $binom(|a|, "len") times f[x]["len"]$, since there are $binom(|a|, "len")$ ways to choose the entries in the array that are not $1$, and for each of these choices, there are $f[x]["len"]$ ways to permute the entries. 

So for each pair of $x$ and $"len"$, the total number of arrays $a$ is given by 

$ sum_(|a| = "len") ^ n (f[x]["len"] times binom(|a|, "len") ) = f[x]["len"] times sum_(|a| = "len") ^ n binom(|a|, "len") = f[x]["len"] times binom(n + 1, "len" + 1), $
where the Hockey-Stick combinatorial identity is applied to the last summation. 

The problem is now quite solvable with the help of modular arithmetic.
